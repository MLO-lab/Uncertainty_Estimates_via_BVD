# Uncertainty Estimates of Predictions via a General Bias-Variance Decomposition

The official source code to [Uncertainty Estimates of Predictions via a General Bias-Variance Decomposition (AISTATS'23)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12256).

## Code for Bregman divergence and Bregman Information generated by LogSumExp

We provide Pytorch and Numpy implementations, which should easily work via Copy-Pasting.
The exact implementation differs slightly from the experiments, since there were unexpectedly positive mathematical results after the experiments had finished.
